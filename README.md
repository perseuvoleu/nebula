# nebula

A fast, low-memory terminal multiplexer for managing Claude Code agents across
projects and git worktrees. Think tmux ergonomics with a mission-control-style
agent manager — entirely inside your terminal.

## Install

macOS or Linux — the same command installs and updates:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perseuvoleu/nebula/main/install.sh | sh
```

Downloads the prebuilt binary for your platform from the latest GitHub release
into `~/.local/bin` (override with `NEBULA_INSTALL_DIR`), falling back to
`cargo install --git` when no release matches.

Once installed, `nebula upgrade` runs that same script for you — no need to
remember the URL. It refuses to clobber a local `cargo build` (pass `--force`
if you mean it). Upgrading while a daemon is running is safe: sessions keep
running on the old binary until you run `nebula kill` (which stops all
sessions) and relaunch.

## Getting started

You'll want at least one agent CLI on your `PATH` first — `claude`, `codex`,
or `cursor-agent`. nebula spawns them; it doesn't ship them.

**1. Add a repo.** nebula is project-first, and a project is just a git
checkout:

```
nebula add ~/code/my-app       # or, from inside the repo: nebula add .
```

**2. Open the TUI.** A bare `nebula` launches it and auto-starts the daemon:

```
nebula
```

You get four columns, left to right: **Projects → Worktrees → Sessions →
Terminal**. `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` (or `←` / `→`) move focus between columns,
`j` / `k` move the selection inside one, and `Enter` drills in. With no
projects yet you get the splash instead — press `n` to add one without
leaving the TUI.

**3. Choose where the agent runs.** Select your project, then a worktree. Every
project starts with one worktree: the checkout itself. Press `n` in the
Worktrees column to branch off into a real `git worktree` (created under
`<repo>/../<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>`). That's the point of the column —
two agents in two worktrees edit two directories and never collide.

**4. Start the agent.** With a worktree selected, press `n` in the Sessions
column. A menu asks what to run — **Claude**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, or a
plain **Terminal (shell)**. `→` on Claude or Codex drills into model and
reasoning-effort submenus; `Enter` anywhere takes your configured defaults.
Name it or accept the default, and nebula spawns the CLI in that worktree and
drops you straight into it. Type your prompt as you normally would.

**5. Leave — it keeps running.** `Ctrl+q` gets you out of the terminal and back
to the panels. That's the key to remember: the agent doesn't care that you
stopped watching. Press `q` to quit nebula entirely and the daemon still owns
every PTY — come back with `nebula` an hour later and each session is where
you left it, scrollback replayed.

**6. Read the dots instead of the screens.** Once you're running more than one
agent you stop reading terminals and start reading the Sessions column: ●
yellow is mid-turn, ● green is done, ● red wants you (a permission prompt or
a question). Projects and worktrees roll their children up, so a red dot on a
collapsed project tells you where to look. Full table under
[Status dots](#status-dots).

**7. Let them name themselves.** Leave a new session on its default name and
the agent retitles it after your first prompt — `Fix Login Redirect` rather
than `agent-3`. Type a name yourself (or `r` to rename) and nebula never
touches it.

From there: `t` opens a shell in the selected worktree, `/` fuzzy-jumps to any
project, worktree or session by name, `w` switches workspaces when one project
list gets long, `s` opens settings, `?` lists every key, and `m` (or
right-click) opens a context menu for whatever's selected.

## Working a worktree

The panels aren't the only view. With a worktree selected, from any panel:

- **`g` — git diff.** Changed files down the left, the diff on the right, with
  a live fuzzy filter. It opens on the working tree (uncommitted changes vs
  HEAD); `Ctrl+g` picks something else to compare — the working tree against
  the branch's upstream, or any recent commit on its own (what that commit
  changed vs its parent). `Ctrl+r` marks a file reviewed ✓ and sinks it to the
  bottom — nebula-side bookkeeping only, no git state is touched — and every
  mark clears itself when HEAD moves or the file changes again, so what's left
  unticked is genuinely what you haven't read.
- **`f` — find file.** Fuzzy finder over the worktree. `Enter` opens the file
  in an editor modal (vim by default; the `editor` setting or `NEBULA_EDITOR`
  picks another), `Ctrl+y` copies the path — ready to paste into an agent.
- **`F` — find in files.** `git grep` into the same modal; `Enter` opens the
  hit at its line.
- **`b` — file tree browser.** Tree on the left, syntax-highlighted preview on
  the right, and an always-live filter that narrows the tree to matching files
  and the directories holding them.
- **`e` — notes.** Free-text notes pinned to a project or a worktree.
- **`l` — links.** Pin a PR, doc or ticket URL to the worktree; it shows up in
  the Sessions panel's LINKS group. nebula also finds the pull request already
  open on the branch with `gh` and lists it there on its own, with a count of
  the comments that landed while you were away.
- **`p` — pin.** Pinned worktrees and agents sort to the top of their panel and
  are spared by the idle reaper.

## How it works

- **Detached daemon (tmux-style).** A background `nebula` daemon owns every
  PTY, so agents keep running when the TUI closes. The TUI is a client that
  attaches over a unix socket (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nebula/` or
  `/tmp/nebula-<uid>/`, mode 0700). Quit the TUI, relaunch later, and your
  sessions are still alive with scrollback replayed.
- **Projects → worktrees → sessions.** All work happens in the main checkout
  or a git worktree. Worktrees are real (`git worktree add/remove`), created
  under `<repo>/../<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>`.
- **Agents boot `claude`, `codex`, or `cursor-agent`.** Creating an agent
  (`n`) first asks which CLI to run, then spawns it in the worktree. Restored
  agents resume with `claude --resume <session-id>` / `codex resume
  <session-id>` / `cursor-agent --resume <session-id>` (falling back to a
  fresh session when the old one is gone).
- **Status via agent-CLI hooks, not MCP.** At agent spawn, nebula merges
  managed hooks into the worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json` (Claude
  Code) or `.cursor/hooks.json` (Cursor CLI), and into `~/.codex/hooks.json`
  (Codex — codex records hook approvals against the hook file's path, so a
  per-worktree file would re-prompt forever; from its home, you approve
  nebula's hooks once at codex's "Hooks need review" prompt and every later
  worktree is silent). Groups are tagged `_nebulaManaged`, user
  hooks preserved, rebuilt each spawn. Each hook is a fail-soft curl to the
  daemon's loopback HTTP endpoint, authenticated with a per-boot bearer token
  injected into the agent's environment only.
- **…plus the progress bar, for the cancel no hook reports.** Escaping out of
  a turn fires no `Stop` and suppresses the idle notification that normally
  un-sticks one, so nebula also reads the CLI's terminal progress-bar escapes
  (OSC 9;4) straight off the PTY. That signal survives a cancel, and it stays
  busy while a permission prompt is open — so it can't green out an agent that
  is actually waiting on you.
- **Sessions title themselves.** Create a session with the default name and
  the agent renames it after your first prompt — a 3-4 word title describing
  the ask (e.g. `Fix Login Redirect`), via a new `nebula rename <title>`
  command the CLI runs in its own turn (no extra API calls, no MCP server).
  Claude Code and Codex get the instruction injected through the
  `UserPromptSubmit` hook response — as
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, the one envelope both read (the
  daemon sends it only while the session is untitled); Cursor gets a
  managed `.cursor/rules/nebula-title.mdc` project rule instead, since its
  hooks can't inject context. Titling is
  one-shot and never clobbers a name you typed or set with `r` — a late
  agent attempt is politely declined. `nebula rename --force` overrides.
- **Everything persists in SQLite** (`~/.local/share/nebula/nebula.db` or the
  platform equivalent): projects, worktrees, agents (with kind + CLI session
  ids), notes, links, workspaces, pins, and your last selection.
- **Sessions warm up, then get reaped.** The daemon can pre-spawn an agent CLI
  while you're still naming the session, and pre-boot a worktree's dead
  sessions while your selection rests on it, so attaching lands on a booted
  screen instead of a booting shell. To bound what that costs, idle PTYs in
  worktrees no client is watching are killed after `session_idle_timeout` (5m
  by default) — pinned agents, working agents, ones waiting on you, and
  terminals with a command running are all spared, and a reaped agent revives
  on the next attach with its conversation resumed.
- **Settings live in one JSON file** (`config.json`, beside the database), read
  fresh on each use by both the daemon and the TUI, so hand edits apply without
  a restart. `s` opens the settings overlay over the same file: color theme,
  animations, focused-panel tint, editor, default model and reasoning effort
  per agent CLI, the RECENT window, the idle timeout, and whether new sessions
  stop to ask for a name.
- **Every panel key is rebindable.** The overlay's Hotkeys tab lists every
  action and what it answers to, and writes overrides into the same file
  (`"keybindings": {"git_diff": "ctrl+g, g"}`); an empty value unbinds. Because
  nebula is always a guest inside Terminal.app / Ghostty / tmux, the tab says
  at bind time when a chord probably won't survive the trip — `⌘` anything,
  `^⇧` without the kitty protocol, `^←` on stock macOS. `Ctrl+q` is the one
  exception to all of it: it unlocks a terminal no matter what you bind, since
  unbinding your way out would trap you in the session.

## Status dots

| Dot | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ● gray | fresh — agent never run |
| ● yellow | running — turn in progress (Stop is gated on active subagents) |
| ● green | finished — turn complete |
| ● red | needs feedback — permission prompt or question waiting on you |
| ● magenta | terminated — process died mid-run |
| ○ | disconnected — daemon restarted while the agent was live |

Worktree and project rows roll up their children: red beats yellow beats green.

## Keys

Defaults — every one of them is rebindable in Settings → Hotkeys (`s`).

| Context | Key | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Panels | `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`, `←/→`, `j/k` | move focus / selection |
| Panels | `Ctrl+→` | cross into the terminal pane without attaching (plain `→` stops at Sessions) |
| Panels | `Enter` | drill in; on a session: attach |
| Any panel | `/` | fuzzy jump across every project, worktree and session (`Ctrl+n/p` move, `Ctrl+o` opens the hit, `Ctrl+f` just lands the selection on it) |
| Projects | `n` / `d` | add project / remove from list |
| Any panel | `o` | add ("open") a project — same prompt as `n`, from any focus |
| Add project | type + `Tab`, `↓↑` / `→` / `←` | browse for the repo: type to filter (bash-style Tab completion), arrows pick a directory, `→` steps in, `←` steps up, `Enter` adds the highlighted (or typed) path; `●` marks git repos |
| Projects | `Shift+J/K` | move project up / down the list (`Shift+↑/↓` too, but Terminal.app never sends those) |
| Projects | `-` | toggle a group divider below the project |
| Projects | `j/k` onto a divider, then `Enter`/`r` | edit the divider's label |
| Projects | `d` or `-` on a divider | delete the divider |
| Worktrees | `n` / `d` | new worktree / delete (typed confirm — deletes files) |
| New worktree | type a sentence, or `Enter` on the empty prompt | the branch name is slugified (`fix login redirect` → `fix-login-redirect`); empty takes a random `<adj>-<noun>-<verb>` |
| Projects / Worktrees | `e` | notes for the selected project / worktree |
| Worktrees / Sessions | `p` | pin / unpin — pinned rows sort to the top and skip the idle reaper |
| Sessions | `n` | new session (agent or shell terminal) |
| Sessions | `r`, `a`, `u`, `d`, `A` | rename, archive, unarchive, delete, toggle archived |
| Any panel | `Shift+D` | delete every row of the focused panel (confirm lists the casualties) |
| Any panel | `g` | git diff for the selected worktree: filter, `↑↓` files, `Shift+↑↓`/`PgUp/PgDn`/`Ctrl+d/u` scroll, `Ctrl+g` picks what to compare (working tree, upstream, a commit), `Ctrl+r` marks a file reviewed ✓ |
| Any panel | `Shift+G` | open the selected repo's page on its git host — the `origin` remote (`git@github.com:o/r.git`, `ssh://`, `https://`) turned into a browsable URL, credentials stripped |
| Any panel | `f` / `F` / `b` | find file / find in files (`git grep`) / file tree browser, all scoped to the selected worktree — `Enter` opens the file in an editor modal (at the matched line, for `F`); in `f` and `b`, `Ctrl+y` copies the path |
| Any panel | `l` | attach a link (pull request, doc, ticket) to the selected worktree — it lands in the Sessions panel's LINKS group, above any open pull request nebula finds with `gh` |
| Sessions | `Enter` / `r` / `d` on a link | open it in the browser / edit its URL / delete it (the detected pull request opens but can't be edited or deleted) |
| Any panel | `t` | new shell terminal in the selected worktree's directory (Projects panel: the repo root) |
| Any panel | `w` | workspace switcher: `Enter` opens, `n`/`r`/`d` create/rename/delete (the open workspace shows bottom-left; `/` and the panels scope to it) |
| Any panel | `h` | ssh hosts: every `nebula ssh` destination, newest first. `Enter`/click reconnects (quits this TUI and execs a fresh `nebula ssh` — local sessions keep running), `a` types a new `user@host [dir]`, `d` removes |
| Any panel | `m` or right-click | context menu |
| Any panel | `z` | full-screen terminal: collapse the sidebars and lock input into the attached session |
| Any panel | `s` | settings overlay (theme, editor, agent defaults, timeouts) — its Hotkeys tab rebinds every key in this table |
| Any panel | `Shift+M` | memory usage: RAM per agent/terminal process tree, nebula itself, and the machine-wide share; `↑/↓` + `Enter` opens the selected session |
| Any panel | `Shift+N` | replay the startup splash (any key returns) |
| Any panel | `?` | help overlay |
| Any panel | `q` / `Ctrl+c` | quit the TUI (sessions keep running) |
| Terminal | anything | forwarded raw to the PTY |
| Terminal | `Ctrl+q` | back to panels (also expands sidebars) — `Ctrl+]`, `Ctrl+Esc` and `Ctrl+←` do the same, for terminals that eat one of them |
| Terminal | mouse wheel | scrollback (arrow keys on alt-screen apps) |
| Any typed field | `←→`/`⌥←→`, `Ctrl+a`/`Ctrl+e`, `⌥⌫`, `Ctrl+u`/`Ctrl+k` | every prompt, filter and query is the same line editor: move by character / word, jump to ends, delete word, kill line |

Mouse: left-click selects/attaches, right-click opens context menus,
double-click in the terminal selects a word, `⌥`-click opens the URL or
`file:line` under the cursor (browser / editor modal), and dragging a panel
border resizes it. Text selection: hold `Shift` while dragging (mouse capture
bypass — same as tmux).

```

### Remote projects

`nebula add findl:~/app` (any `ssh` destination — an alias from `~/.ssh/config`
works) adds a checkout that lives on another machine. **The sessions live
there too**: the host's own nebula daemon owns the PTYs, and your daemon
mirrors them over one ssh connection per host (`ssh host nebula proxy`, which
also boots the host daemon when it isn't running). Close the laptop and the
agent keeps working; open it and the pane repaints from the live screen.
Status dots, auto-titles and `nebula rename` are the host daemon's own hooks,
so nothing is tunnelled.

What you see: one project row — the remote checkout is absorbed into the
local project of the same name (or stands on its own when there is none) —
with the host's worktrees, sessions and tabs under it wearing a pink `@findl`
badge. Every session picker offers the other side (`Run on findl ▸` in `n`,
flat `Claude on findl` … rows in ⌘T/⌘D), `--project name@host` picks the
remote twin on the command line, and `nebula remote <host> …` is the
host-side view: status, sessions, a live watch, skills + fast-forward sync of
every remote checkout, upgrade, restart.

The diff, branch and grep views run git on the host over ssh; `t` shells
land in the remote checkout. Local-only tools — the editor, file finder,
tree browser, `gh` — say so instead of opening a remote path. A dropped link
reconnects on its own; the host needs `nebula` and the agent CLIs (logged in)
installed, and `ControlMaster` in `~/.ssh/config` is welcome for the git
hops. Stopping *your* daemon never ends a remote session;
`nebula remote <host> restart` is what does.

Settings: `~/.local/share/nebula/config.json` (or the platform equivalent),
beside the database — hand-editable, and what the `s` overlay writes.

Logs: `~/.local/state/nebula/daemon.log` and `tui.log` (`NEBULA_LOG=debug` for
more). `NEBULA_EDITOR` overrides the configured editor. Overrides for
tests/parallel instances: `NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR`, `NEBULA_DATA_DIR`,
`NEBULA_AGENT_CMD`, `NEBULA_INSTALL_URL`.

## Building

```
cargo build --release     # → target/release/nebula (~4 MB)
cargo test                # unit + end-to-end suite (spawns real daemons/PTYs)
```

Workspace layout: `nebula-core` (shared protocol/entities), `nebula-daemon`
(PTYs, SQLite, hook receiver, status engine), `nebula-tui` (ratatui client),
`nebula` (the binary). `vendor/vt100` is a patched copy of the terminal
parser, wired in through `[patch.crates-io]`: rows scrolled out of a
top-anchored scroll region go to scrollback instead of being discarded, so
wheel-up over a codex session has something to show.

Releases: push a `v*` tag (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`) and CI builds
mac (arm/intel) and linux (x64/arm64, static musl) binaries and attaches them
to a GitHub release — which is what `install.sh` downloads.
