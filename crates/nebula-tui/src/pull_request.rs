//! feeds sits above the worktree's saved links and refreshes on its own, so
//! a PR opened outside nebula shows up without anyone typing its URL. The
//! one thing that outlives the process is how far the user has read into
//! the conversation, which the daemon keeps (`pr_seen`) so the row can say
//! how many comments landed while they were away.

//! `gh` may be missing, unauthenticated, or pointed at a repo with no
//! remote; every one of those is an ordinary "no PR" answer, not an error
//! worth a flash. Lookups are async because they hit the network.
